<h1>Cow Say Scheduling</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Monitoring employee schedules is essential for optimizing workforce management, maintaining compliance, enhancing productivity, ensuring customer satisfaction, and promoting a positive work environment. It helps strike a balance between the needs of the business and the well-being of its employees.

<br> For this project, I was hired by Lucky Duck Casino in the capacity of a Security Analyst. My role involved developing a shell script designed to efficiently analyze employee schedules. The purpose of this script is to aid in identifying the employee on duty during specific times, particularly in situations involving future losses or incidents.
